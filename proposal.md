# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pong Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A classic game of pong. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will create a pong game which allows for two players to play a the classic game of pong. The software will create a window and set the scene for the game. It will then begin the game. It will have the normal features but I will add something of my own which I do not know what yet. It will be excecuted using lua and love.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At the very least I hope to get a new understanding of different programming languages which I have not been exposed to. I hope to be able to navigate these languages good enough to create a decent pong game with a twist of my own. Regardless of how it turns out, I just hope I learn something valuable which will stick to be beyond this class. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be if I can really use the new languages in a way that I did not think I could. If I can find a way to use either langauge outside of the project it would also be a good outcome. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for the project would be for me to become really comfortable with all of the new and existing languages that I know through different implementation through completing my project. I just hope that I can not only be able to submit the project but also learn something valuable along the way. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For now, I will start simple by just watching some introductory videos which guide through the basics of the project. Then as time goes by I will continue to take small steps in order to complete the project. 
I will need to learn the basics of Lua and Love. Since they are both in languages I have not used to code before, it will be a new skill to learn both. 
I will need to research about the languages, the structure of the game, other similar games, and a lot of guides for making games using Lua.
